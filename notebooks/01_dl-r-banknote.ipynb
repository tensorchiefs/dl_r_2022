You will see that fully connected networks without a hidden layer can only learn linar decision boundaries, while fully connected networks with hidden layers are able to learn non-linear decision boundaries.\n\n__Usage__: The idea of the notebook is that you try to understand the provided code. Run it, check the output, and play with it by slightly changing the code. There are some questions the answer along the code\n\n__Dataset__: You work with a banknote data set and classification task. We have 5 features that were extracted from wavelet transformed images of banknotes:\n\n1. variance (continuous feature)\n\n2. skewness (continuous feature)\n\n3. curtosis (continuous feature)\n\n4. entropy (continuous feature)\n\n5. class (binary indicating if the banknote is real or fake)\n\nDon't bother too much how these features exactely came from.\nFor this analysis we only use 2 features.\n\n\nx1: skewness of wavelet transformed image\n\nx2: entropy of wavelet transformed image\n\n__The goal is to classify each banknote to either \"real\" (Y=0) or \"fake\" (Y=1), or in a probabilistic model to predict the probability for \"real\" or \"fake\".__\n\n__Content:__\n\n* visualize the data in a simple scatter plot and color the points by the class label\n* use the Keras library to build a fcNN without hidden layers (logistic regression). Use SGD with the * objective to minimize the crossentropy loss.\n* visualize the learned decision boundary in a 2D plot\n* use the Keras library to build a fcNN with a single hidden layer. Use SGD with the objective to \n* minimize the crossentropy loss.\n* visualize the learned decision boundary in a 2D plot\n* compare the performace and the decision boundaries of the two models\n* stack more hidden layers to the model and playaround with the epochs","metadata":{"_uuid":"b839a0bb-ac21-4ee1-93de-9ff9b5f0617a","_cell_guid":"bcd4a05a-1567-475c-a462-83623d21c441","collapsed":false,"id":"NizZ7atiCceE","jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Installing TensorFlow and Keras\n\nThe deep learning packages, TensorFlow and Keras are not installed by default, but can be installed as follows:","metadata":{"_uuid":"462da47e-003c-4ed0-a775-2fe77905a9df","_cell_guid":"9db12abd-dc57-464b-a0c9-d1df36f721fd","id":"M1wzgBlEFPrq","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Installing TF and Keras takes approx 2 minutes\nif (FALSE){\n#Installing of tensorflow and keras (needed for colab / not needed for kaggle notebooks)\n    install.packages(\"tensorflow\")\n    install.packages(\"keras\")\n    install.packages(\"RCurl\")\n    install.packages(\"kableExtra\")    \n}\n#proc.time() - ptm\n#devtools::install_github(\"rstudio/keras\") works ok but no tfp\nlibrary(keras)\nlibrary(tensorflow)\ntf$version$VERSION #2.3.0","metadata":{"_uuid":"7861b957-5e5c-4d31-9c3e-b0a7da4e27a3","_cell_guid":"17641d63-c4cf-4b7d-8851-7d366f5968e8","collapsed":false,"id":"goTZsQAy_VbC","outputId":"95b6a9e8-9645-4139-b248-0b66dd74ed6a","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-12T13:00:28.445146Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-12T13:00:28.447241Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-12T13:00:37.139491Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Imports and loading the data\n\nIn the next cell, we load all the required libraries and functions. \nWe also download the data with the 5 featues from the provided url.","metadata":{"_uuid":"e0a3ca71-529a-4142-b45d-5ba4f28b3f10","_cell_guid":"39b179d6-3a3f-422c-a44a-c90d74e3735e","id":"ZdfzJAx_iD4h","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(keras)\nlibrary(RCurl)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n#library(kableExtra)\nmyurl = \"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00267/\"\nfname = \"data_banknote_authentication.txt\"\nmyurl = paste0(myurl, fname)\nif(url.exists(myurl)) {\n  dataset = read.table(myurl, sep=\",\")\n}\ndim(dataset)","metadata":{"_uuid":"f2ab61fa-cc45-4f30-91e6-e19e674e55fc","_cell_guid":"6f81c2f9-ae90-4f07-a544-f0e2e4c55fa2","collapsed":false,"id":"cVYwcayKiJ85","outputId":"f403ac34-9850-4df5-d594-7ca6d31ae6ad","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-12T13:01:11.066742Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-12T13:01:11.068137Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-12T13:01:11.857763Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The object _dataset_ has 1372 rows and 5 columns.\n\nLet's extract the two featues _x1: skewness of wavelet transformed image_ and _x2: entropy of wavelet transformed image_.
