### Opening colab notebooks for students
* The notebook in github: [https://github.com/tensorchiefs/dl_rcourse_2022/blob/main/notebooks/00_R_Keras_TF_TFP.ipynb](https://github.com/tensorchiefs/dl_rcourse_2022/blob/main/notebooks/00_R_Keras_TF_TFP.ipynb)
Note that `blob` in the url, with can be created by browsing in github to the relevant location and pressing the `raw` button or in the context menu use `copy link address` 

* The link that opens in notebook in colab [https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorchiefs/dl_rcourse_2022/blob/main/notebooks/00_R_Keras_TF_TFP.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorchiefs/dl_rcourse_2022/blob/main/notebooks/00_R_Keras_TF_TFP.ipynb)
The link is created by appending `https://colab.research.google.com/github/` to the repository location `tensorchiefs/dl_rcourse_2022/blob/main/notebooks/00_R_Keras_TF_TFP.ipynb`.

### Editing notebooks for teacher
Currently the simplest way is to download the notebooks from colab and upload them to github. Directly checking into the reposity does not work.
